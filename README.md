# Portfolio Website

This personal portfolio website (www.chinthujan.com) was created with the intention to:
1. Have a central location for more information about myself, my projects, and my professional goals.
2. An ongoing project that allows me to implement the skills I learn as I advance through my career as an aspiring developer (UI/UX design, front-end tools, back-end tools, SEO, and more).

## Roadmap
- Light/Dark mode option
- Implement better UI hierarchy
- Animate aspects of the web page using CSS
- Organize skills section in a cleaner way
